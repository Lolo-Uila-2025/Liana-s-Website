      <h2>Two things I did With Lolo Uila That I enjoyed</h2>
      <p>The first thing that we did which I enjoyed doing was being introduced to what an Arduino Board is. A simple definition of what an arduino board is, a small single-board microcontroller inexpensive computer that can be used to interact with the physical world. My favorite thing that we did using our arduino boards was the security buzzer test. We used an altrosonic sensor to be able to sense when there is movement. We also used codes to make an LED light bulb go off whenever the sensor would go off. Another thing that we used almost every class was a bread board. We would used wires to connect our arduino boards to our breadboard. A breadboard is a board that is used to connect eletronic components to conduct various experiments and projects, like our sensor experiment. These are two things that we did in Lolo Uila this year.  </p>

      <h2>Two Things I did in Residential That I enjoyed</h2>
      <p>One of the activities that we did in residential that I enjoyed was our newspaper/paper fasionshow. We were in groups of four, and me and my team designed an outfit based on PapaHanaumoku. We designed a dress for our friend who was our model. We made him a shark and added Nius (coconuts) along the dress. When the fasionshow was over each team won an award, and the award that we won was Most Cutsey Poses. My second favorite thing that we did with residential was our movie night. All 32 of us got to have popcorn and snacks from Aunty Lisa and her team. We got to watch The Minecraft Movie all together and everyone had a fun time hanging out with eachother and watching the movie.
